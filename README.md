# Sinatra & Vue boilerplate
This repository contains a skeleton application written in Ruby and JS.  
Ideally, it will be used to prototype simple web applications made up an API (written with Sinatra) and a single page application (written in Vue.js).

## To do list:
- ~~Add and configure Webpack~~
- Add database support (Postgress + Sqlite3 )
- Add Redis + Sidekiq
- ~~Add Vue + Vue.router~~
- Add sample APIs to consume
- Add Oauth (+ JWT tokens?)
- Add Rspec tests
- Add CI with GitHub Actions
- ~~Serve compiled assets~~
- ~~Deploy on Heroku~~
